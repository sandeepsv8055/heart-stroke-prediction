# ❤️ Heart Stroke Prediction App

A Machine Learning powered web application that predicts the risk of heart disease based on medical parameters.

Built using **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit** and deployed as an interactive web app.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project compares multiple supervised machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease risk.

After evaluating different models, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** achieved the best performance and was selected for deployment.

The final model is integrated into a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.
